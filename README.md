[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

NAME: ricepest Spatial Model

DESCRIPTION: Generic RICEPEST tool for calculating attainable and actual yields based on supplied parameters

REQUIREMENTS: ArcGIS Spatial Analyst Extension

DEVELOPED BY: Confidence Duku (AfricaRice), Adam Sparks (IRRI), Sander Zwart (AfricaRice)

BASED ON WORK DONE BY: Laetitia Willocquet and Serge Savary (IRRI)

The original version of this model written in Python by Duku used `arcpy`
extensions. The goal of this repository is to use only FOSS GIS tools
to write the RICEPEST model in Python and possibly R as well.
